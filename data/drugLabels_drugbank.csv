(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and

(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:
a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];

b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and

c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].","['G01AE10', 'G04BE03']",inhibitor,16815627,Q13956,cncg_human,cncg,Rod/cone cGMP-PDE gamma subunit family,Rod/cone cGMP-PDE gamma subunit family
